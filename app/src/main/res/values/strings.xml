Liability and Limitation of Liability:\nThe application and the services provided therein are offered \"as-is\" (\"AS-IS\"). The developers are not responsible for adapting the System to the user\'s needs, for any errors, inaccuracies, or changes in the information displayed, or for any changes made by the user or third parties. The developers shall not be liable for any direct or indirect damages resulting from use of the System, including damages arising from call answering, automated call answering, the golden number, the Quick Call feature, or any other component of the application. Users assume all risk regarding use of the System, and the developers accept no liability for malfunctions, operational failures, or damages resulting from improper use or over-reliance on the System.\n\n7. Changes, Updates, and Termination of Service:\nThe operators of the application reserve the right to modify, update, or discontinue the System at any time without prior notice.\n\n8.

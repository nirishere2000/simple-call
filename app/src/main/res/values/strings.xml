    <string name="terms_and_conditions">Welcome to the %1$s application.\n\nThe application has been developed as an aid tool for adult users, and its purpose is to facilitate easier call management on Android devices and enable quick contact with predefined contacts in distress situations.\n\nThe application and the services provided through it shall hereinafter be referred to as \"the System\".\n\n1. Agreement to the Terms:\nUse of the System is subject to the following Terms (\"the Terms\"). Please read these Terms carefully before using the System. Your use of the System constitutes your full and irrevocable acceptance of these Terms.\n\nIf you do not agree to these Terms, in whole or in part, please do not use the System and remove it from your device immediately.\n\n2. Summary of the System\'s Purpose:\nFacilitating easier call management by emphasizing large buttons and text optimized for elderly users.\n\n3. Important Clarification Regarding the Distress Button and Automated Call Answering:\n* It is recommended to initially test the distress button functionality with a predefined contact and in coordination with them to ensure proper operation. The System includes a distress button designed for quick dialing to a predefined phone number, and may also feature automated call answering and a \"golden number\" function. It is important to emphasize that the application is not a professional emergency application and does not replace direct contact with official emergency centers (such as police, ambulance, fire brigade, etc.). Reliance solely on the distress button or automated call answering in critical situations is not advised, as malfunctions may occur (e.g., signal issues, network failures, permission blocks, operating system limitations, or battery-saving restrictions). It is recommended to have additional backup means for emergency communication.\n\n4. Privacy, Personal Data Protection, and Call Recording:\nThe System enables users to view various data stored on the smartphone, such as contacts and call logs as saved in the device. This information is not stored within the application nor shared with any third party. Please note that the application does not record any telephone calls made through it, and the System does not store or log calls in any manner.\n\n5. Usage Restrictions:\nIt is strictly prohibited to use the System for any purpose other than personal or private use, or for any commercial purposes, including the dissemination of false alerts using the distress button.\n\n6. Liability and Limitation of Liability:\nThe application and the services provided therein are offered \"as-is\" (\"AS-IS\"). The developers are not responsible for adapting the System to the user\'s needs, for any errors, inaccuracies, or changes in the information displayed, or for any changes made by the user or third parties. The developers shall not be liable for any direct or indirect damages resulting from use of the System, including damages arising from call answering, automated call answering, the golden number, the distress button, or any other component of the application. Users assume all risk regarding use of the System, and the developers accept no liability for malfunctions, operational failures, or damages resulting from improper use or over-reliance on the System.\n\n7. Changes, Updates, and Termination of Service:\nThe operators of the application reserve the right to modify, update, or discontinue the System at any time without prior notice.\n\n8. Contact for Inquiries or Complaints:\nFor inquiries, complaints, or questions, please contact support@easycallandanswer.com.\n\n9. User Declaration and Consent:\nPlease note: This window is displayed solely for reading and reviewing the Terms and does not constitute acceptance. Acceptance of the Terms is done on the previous screen by selecting \"I agree to the Terms of Use\".\nBy selecting \"I agree to the Terms of Use\", you declare that you have read, understood, and fully agree to these Terms.\n\n10. Intellectual Property Rights:\nAll content, features, and functionality within the System, including but not limited to software, text, graphics, logos, and design, are the exclusive property of the developers and are protected by intellectual property laws.\n\nAll Rights Reserved © Easy Call and Answer 2025.</string>

    <string name="tour_distress_button_description">* It is recommended to initially test the distress button functionality with a predefined contact to ensure proper operation.\n\nThe distress button in the app is designed to help you quickly reach out for assistance in an emergency situation, and it remains active even if outgoing calls are completely disabled in the app settings. However, you must ensure that both the device and the app are capable of making outgoing calls.\n\nPlease note that the app is not intended to serve as a professional emergency application, does not substitute official emergency services and is not directly connected to emergency centers such as police, ambulance, or fire brigade.\n\nHowever, you can configure the distress button to dial a specific emergency number, if the necessary permission is granted to retrieve emergency numbers.\n\nEmergency numbers are retrieved from the Android system, and therefore depend on your region and device. This means that the numbers may not always be appropriate for the country you are in. When choosing an emergency number, it is your responsibility to verify that it is the correct one for you.\n\nAdditionally, you can select a contact (if Contacts permission is granted) whom the app will attempt to call in an emergency situation.\n\nImportant: The button requires Phone (outgoing call) permission on the device itself to function! It is also recommended to set the app as the default phone dialer; otherwise, the app may attempt to place the call externally.\n\nIf the distress button displays a bell icon, it is ready for use. Otherwise, please make sure your device supports outgoing calls and that Phone permission is granted.\n\nIf permissions are missing, you can grant them via the Permissions screen in the app or in the device settings.</string>
